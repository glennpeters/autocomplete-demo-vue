# Vue AutoComplete Example

Building towards the guidelines below, limiting the scope because of external time pressures.

Using an <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/vuejs-vue-autocomplete-component#step-1-setting-up-the-project">Autocomplete tutorial for time management</a>.




## Code Challenge Requirements

In the code challenge, you will take PDF mockups and recreate them in web format, including all assets in the attached file. 

We are looking for a responsive site (tablet and mobile views) with some simple JavaScript, good structure, and solid CSS layout. We would like to see custom media queries. You can use a JavaScript framework (e.g. Vue, Angular 2, React, etc.).

Key points to this challenge are:

- [ ] Make an ‘autocomplete’ of sorts in the main search bar using any api: 
    * https://swapi.co/api/ 
    * https://swapi.co/documentation
    * https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
    * etc.
- [X] You can do it in any JavaScript framework.
- [] Do not use a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Bulma, Foundation, etc.)(Normalize.css is okay to use).
- [ ] Make sure the application can be installed and built (npm etc).
- [ ] We are looking for structure and how you would build something as if you were planning for a scalable application. (Caveat: given the time limitations, the extent of consideration this gets is using React itself, which is highly structured and includes tests)
- [ ] We would like to see custom media queries.
- [ ] Ideal, write up documentation
